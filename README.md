Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    //when the planner opens, the current day is displayed
   // the day is at the top



WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
    when scrolling, timeblocks for standard business hours displays

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    timeblocks for each day are color coded
    past- light grey
    present- red
    future- green

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
    click event for timeblock
    event form

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    click event for save button
    save to local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
